# üåê GMS Messaging

 Welcome to **GMS Messaging**, a multi-user chat client that operates via **WebSocket and REST polling** and has a terminal-style interface.  


 It is intended to be quick, easy, and somewhat vintage. You'll like:
 - ‚úÖ Chat interface inspired by Terminal 
 - üé®  Personal nicknames 
 - üè∑ Customizable themes  
 - üåç Multi-user, real-time messaging  

 For the time being, simplicity is the aim.

 ## üìñ Beginning

 1. To view all of the commands that are available, start with `help`.

 2. **Use `join \preset|url>` to connect to a server**

 **Preset:** `gms` ‚Üí establishes a connection to the primary server.
 You can connect to any WebSocket/REST server by using the **Custom URL.**

 You're good once connected.
